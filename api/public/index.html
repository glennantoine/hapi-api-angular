            <h2>Built on hapi.js combined with a number of additional libraries</h2>
            <p>Hapi is a framework designed for building scalable applications and services. hapi enables developers to focus on writing reusable application logic instead of spending time building infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Hapi.js was built after a period of trial and error by the Walmart mobile development team, using some of the most popular frameworks in the node.js community.  Through the lessons learned during this process the decision was made to build a framework specifically for the purpose of developing scalable APIs that could handle the kinds of traffic they see on a daily basis. More importantly these applications had to perform under extreme traffic such as Black Friday.</p>
